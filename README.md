SolarizedQuassel
================
In this repository you'll find several skins for for the [Quassel IRC Client][quassel] that I've created to the specification of [Ethan Schoonover's Solarized Scheme][solarized]. 

I am a long-term fan of [Solarized][solarized], and use it in every single text based environment that I can. Unfortunately there don't appear to be any other [Solarized][solarized] stylesheets for [Quassel][quassel], so I took it upon myself to port over the specification myself (to the best of my ability, there is very little documentation available in regards to theming [Quassel][quassel]).
